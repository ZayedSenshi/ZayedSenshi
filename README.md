# Hi ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my Github profile! :nerd_face:

## I am an aspiring software developer currently on the [HyperionDev Bootcamp!](https://skills.cogrammar.com/)
### A little about me...
In the little hours I have during the day, I spend most of it imparting knowledge to teenagers, yep, I'm a full time teacher. **However**, the time has come for the teacher to become the student (corny, I know, but hey). The road to becoming a computer programmer... **has begun**!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills on the fundamentals on Python. I am achieveing this by completing the tasks on the bootcamp and creating small projects for myself. I'm also a member of [The Python Coding Place](https://thepythoncodingplace.thinkific.com/enrollments) which I am using to further develop my skills and knowledge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming with User-Defined Functions 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any small scale projects designed for a fledgling like myself. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to create more complex star patterns to practice the for loop. :exploding_head:
